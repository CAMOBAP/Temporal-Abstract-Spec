The OGC Temporal Domain Working Group was established in 2013 and produced a draft Best Practice for Time. It was presented to various OGC and other meetings, but never matured into a document to be approved. 

Version 0.3, dated 2014, was the latest draft.

The document contains (too) much useful information, but needs to have recommendations that are actionable. Currently it is just a 'brain dump'.
