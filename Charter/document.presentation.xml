<clause id="_purpose_of_the_standards_working_group" obligation="normative" displayorder="4">
<title depth="1">2.<tab/>Purpose of the Standards Working Group</title>
<p id="_4aad8932-6c6b-614b-d8d0-17f65fae1032">The current OGC Standards treat time as an after-thought. After all, buildings don’t move and continents move very slowly. However, the adoption of Moving Features Standards by the geospatial community brings time to the forefront. The location of a Moving Feature is a unique event in space and time. Time is now part of the Feature Geometry. Temporal precision and accuracies of 1 millisecond and below are common. This SWG will revisit the existing ISO and OGC Standards with the intention of making time an integral part of Feature Geometry.</p>

<p id="_605678ff-d7a1-0486-e424-947e9c26d73c">Once Features begin to move there is little to keep them Earth-bound. As a result, geospatial is moving off-planet. Investigations into the use of existing geospatial techologies on the Moon, Mars, and even interplanetary space were begun in Testbed 18 and will continue in Testbed 19. For this work to succeed, our concepts of space and time cannot be limited to terrestrial applications. Calendars for Lunar residents should not be based on Terrestrial astronomical phenomenon. Measurements of time must accomodate the vast distances and velocities encountered in interplanetary space. And all of this must cleanly integrate into a 4D spatial-temporal geometry.</p>

<p id="_706be07f-87e1-0a99-186c-17595c87bb15">This work will leverage the ISO TC211 Harmonized UML Model. The Harmonized model is a single conceptual model encompasing most of the ISO TC211 suite of standards. It provides a rigourous, accessible, and navigatable representation of those standards. The Temporal Abstract Specification will be based on an extension to this model. Thereby assuring that the Temporal Abstract Specification is complete, correct, and coherent.</p>

<title depth="1">3.<tab/>Business value proposition</title>
<p id="_59c88095-04a1-f98f-ad9a-d1ecc5147297">Existing standards treat location and time as separate properties defined by different reference systems. This makes representations of Moving Features as trajectories in space and time difficult. Techniques must be developed to assure that the spatial and temporal properties are properly correlated. Furthermore, the use of different spatial and temporal reference systems restrict the analytics available. What is the distance between two events in spacetime? Integration of space and time into a single geometry greatly simplifies these tasks.</p>

<p id="_23449d4a-ebef-0a8f-6351-cd87849eb4b7">Expanding the scope of this geometry to non-Terrestrial applications broadens the market for many geospatial disciplines. Facilities planning, construction, maintenance, and disposition should not requrire different tools depending on where the facility will be located. Facilities management tools that work on the Earth should also work for Lunar and Martian facilities.</p>

<p id="_a4af15ff-91c7-a105-a160-591e14724c6b">Moving Features that are not planet-bound face additional issues. Due the the distances and velocities involved, Special and General Relativity begin to have a noticable effect. The mathematics for addressing relativistic effects are based on Minkowski spacetime. A 4D spatial-temporal reference system. Accomodation of Minkowski spacetime and similar 4D Coordinate Reference Systems is essential if OGC Standards are going to support this domain.</p>

<p id="_446eff02-903b-288c-638b-ad1693ee9bab">This Standards Working Group will develop an Abstract Specification for Temporal data. It will seek to integrate coordinate reference systems (ISO 19111) and temporal reference systems (ISO 19108) in a single conceptual model. In the process it will also expand our concept of temporal data to better accomodate moving features and non-terrestrial envionments.</p>

<p id="_9b3d2470-d35d-a373-2d3f-81f3d1388265">This work is expected to inform further work on the W3C Temporal Ontology and updates to ISO 19108.</p>
