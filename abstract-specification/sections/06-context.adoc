== Abstract Temporal Reference Model

=== Context

When OGC standards involve time, they generally refer to the ISO documents such as ISO 19108, ISO 19111, ISO 8601, and their freely available OGC equivalents, such as Abstract Specification Topic 2 Referencing by Coordinates (equivalent to ISO 19111).

When dealing with temporal reference systems, it is necessary to understand all of these standards and how they interact. ISO Technical Committee 211 (TC211) provides a useful tool for integrating their standards. The https://github.com/ISO-TC211/HMMG[Harmonized UML model ] provides a single integrated model for most of the TC211 Standards. That model will provide the foundation for the Abstract Temporal Reference Model.

The role of temporal reference systems in the TC211 universe is illustrated below.

Some Observations:

. Many temporal reference systems are not coordinate reference systems
. There is no temporal equivalent to the Compound Reference System
. DateTime should be represented as a compound reference system consisting of a TM_Calendar and TM_Clock reference system.
. TM_Calendar should be a type of TM_OrdinalReferenceSystem. 
. TM_Clock should not be defined in terms of a "day". Many clocks count elapsed time since an epoc. Date and time are not considered.
. TM_Clock should be a type of TM_CoordinateSystem
. TM_Calendar can be defined as a Compound Reference System composed of days, months, and years. This would allow to define meaningful calendars for the Moon, Mars, and other non-Terrestrial environments.
. Is there an ordinal equivalent to TM_Clock. Sunrise, noon, sunset, and midnight?
. Can a calendar be defined in terms of planting season, Saints days, or other arbitrary events?
